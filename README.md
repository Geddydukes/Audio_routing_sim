# Audio_routing_sim
A deterministic + learnable simulator that ingests multi-track audio events (speech, SFX, music), runs rule- and ML-based classification, and dynamically routes stems through a virtual post-production bus graph (EQ, comp, spatializer, loudness) to produce exportable mixes + audit trails.
